"""**ParaQeet: A quantum optimal control toolkit with simple parameter management.**

Choose a pulse parametrization, simulate a quantum system, and optimize.
The package is organized in layers, each interacting only with the layer
above it in the hierarchy:

- ``signal``: pulse parametrizations (envelopes, generators, mixers).
- ``hamiltonian``: Hamiltonian, composite Hamiltonian, and drive Hamiltonians.
- ``eom``: different equations of motion.
- ``propagation``: solvers of the equation of motion.
- ``measurement``: fidelities and other goal functions.
- ``optimizers``: optimization algorithms (gradient based and gradient free).

All tunable values are represented by ``Quantity`` objects. The parameters to
optimize are collected in an ``OptimizationMap``, which is handed to an
optimizer together with a goal function.

The package borrows ideas of semi-automatic differentiation from :cite:p:`goerz2022quantum`,
and combines automatic differentiation with analytic quantum optimal control gradients.
