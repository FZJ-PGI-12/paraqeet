>[!NOTE]
> Development happens on [JuGit](https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/pgi-12-external/qfc/paraqeet). The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FZJ-PGI-12/paraqeet) is a read-only mirror, so please open issues and merge requests on JuGit.


Choose a pulse parametrisation, simulate a quantum system, and optimize. 

Combining Quantum Optimal Control (QOC) methods with automatic differentiation with JAX.
Aimed at resource efficient computation.

We use a top-down approach to make the codebase modular. 
Each module interacts only with the module above it in hierarchy.

Currently implemented QOC methods:
- **GRAPE**: Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering
- **GOAT**: Gradient Optimization of Analytic conTrols
- **dCRAB** : (Gradient based) dressed Chopped RAndom Basis
- **GOAToverGRAPE**: A variant of GROUP that optimizes continuous pulse parameters with GRAPE inside.
- **AD**: Automatic differentiation of the state/propagator evolution

Currently implemented propagation methods:
- **Expm**: Matrix exponential using JAX ``expm``
- **ExpmChebyshev**: Matrix exponential using Chebyshev polynomial expansion
- **ODE solvers**: Diffrax, Verner 7th order method, and Scipy Runge-Kutta methods

Propagation methods can be freely combined with QOC methods, e.g. GOAT optimization using the ``ExpmChebyshev`` propagator.
